# Loan Risk Prediction with AI 

![ANN](https://github.com/shafin071/lending-club-TF-Keras/blob/master/ANN.gif)

## Situation:
LendingClub is an American peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. Procured a dataset curated from Lending Club that contained history of paids off & defaulted loans

## Task:
Performed data pre-processing. Built an Artifical Neural Network (ANN) model with TensorFlow / Keras and trained it with the pre-procssed dataset to predict loan outcome

## Action:
The analysis notebook consists of 6 segments:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Train-Test Split
4. Creating an ANN Model with TF and Keras
5. Evaluating Model Performance
6. Prediction

## Result:
Model predicted loan outcome with **0.94 precision** and **0.93 recall**

## Resources used for this project:
* 90MB LendingCLub Dataset
* Google Colab Notebook
* Python v3
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Imblearn (for balancing dataset)
* Tensorflow / Keras
